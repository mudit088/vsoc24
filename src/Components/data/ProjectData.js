When the images and data of a student are input into the system, the model is trained with the face encoding (face key), which is stored in a YAML file. This File is later used for recognizing students. Once a student is recognized, their attendance is recorded in an Excel file with a timestamp. In the end, the system checks for any absent students and sends an email message to their parents, notifying them that their child is absent today.\nEventually this is Beneficial For\nSafety of Student’s\nConcern of Parents\n",

Each person's images are stored in separate folders.\nIt reads images, converts them to grayscale, resizes them, and flattens into a single vector for further processing.\nDimensionality Reduction with PCA:\nPCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the face images.\nEigenfaces (principal components) are extracted using PCA.\nVisualization:\nEigenfaces (principal components) are visualized.\nFeature Projection:\nTraining and testing data are projected onto the eigenfaces space.\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):\nLDA is applied for further feature extraction.\nClassification using MLP Classifier:\nMLP classifier is trained on the features extracted by LDA.\nEvaluation:\nPredictions are made on the test set, and accuracy is calculated.\nThe code visualizes some of the test images with their predicted and true labels.\nIdeas List:\nImprove model performance by tuning hyperparameters of MLPClassifier.\nExperiment with different dimensionality reduction techniques and compare their performances.\nImplement other classification algorithms and compare their results with MLP.\nEnhance the visualization of eigenfaces and prediction results.\nExtend the project to real-time face recognition using webcam input.\nExplore techniques to handle imbalanced datasets if applicable.\nThis project provides a good starting point for understanding face recognition pipelines and experimenting with various techniques to improve performance.\nGithub link:https://github.com/narmadhajs/Face_Recognition\n",
